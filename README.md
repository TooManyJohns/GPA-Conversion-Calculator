# GPA-Conversion-Calculator
Can decipher GPAs from different universities I have added, created 2 years ago by me

Some notes: I made this two years ago so it is limited to what I know now compared to what I knew then, and I have 3 standard GPA's to convert from. The 3 are Carleton University, OttawaU, and a standard average of how the United States college system does it (on their 4.0 GPA scaling system). This program gives out your letter grade, your GPA standing for the selected university system, and how many courses you are in.
